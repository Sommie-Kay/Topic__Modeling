# Topic Modelling of Tweets about Banks in Nigeria

## Introduction
Topic modelling is a popular technique used in natural language processing and machine learning to discover hidden thematic structure in a collection of text documents. In this portfolio project, I applied KMeans clustering to model tweets related to banks in Nigeria. The goal was to identify distinct topics or themes within the tweets and gain insights into public opinions, concerns, and discussions about banks in Nigeria.

## Business Objectives
The primary objective of this project was to analyze the sentiment and topics discussed in tweets related to banks in Nigeria. By clustering the tweets into meaningful topics, we aimed to uncover valuable insights that could inform decision-making processes within the banking industry.

## Project Details
- **Data Source:** Twitter
